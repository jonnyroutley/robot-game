# Pie, Robot
### A game made with [Pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel) inspired by [Pazzi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNpBDwYLi-Q) and [625 Sandwich Stacker](https://archive.org/details/flash_625-sandwich-stacker).

*Order's Up! Help your robot friend make pizzas by collecting the right ingredients and avoiding the bad stuff.*

Collecting the right types/quantities of ingredients according to the order earns points, with a bonus for every correct pizza completed.

Collecting a wrong ingredient will incur a strike, and if it's one of the nasty ones (*is that a... human nose?*) will mean you have to start the order over. Three strikes and it's game over !
